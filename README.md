# Process-Manager-Simulation
A Python-based simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms and memory paging.   This tool models processes with attributes (ID, name, grade, CPU burst time, priority) and simulates their execution under different scheduling policies, alongside a basic memory paging mechanism.
